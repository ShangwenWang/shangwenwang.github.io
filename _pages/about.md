Welcome to Shangwen Wang's (王尚文) homepage!

Currently, I am an assistant professor at National University of Defense Technology. I have obtained my bachelor degree, master degree, and doctor degree from NUDT at June 2017, December 2019, and December 2023, respectively. During my master and doctor study, I was honored to be supervised by Prof. Xiaoguang Mao. My research interests mainly focus on AI4SE, program repair, software testing, software maintenance and evolution, mining software repositories, and empirical software engineering.

From May 2022 to July 2023, I was a visiting student at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), supervised by Prof. [Yepang Liu](https://yepangliu.github.io/).
